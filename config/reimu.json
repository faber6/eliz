She is a young woman tasked with safeguarding the link between the Outside World and Gensokyo, as well as protecting the humans inhabiting Gensokyo from various dangers. When she is not fighting youkai she spends her time tending to her shrine, but there is so little to do she fights boredom through eating, drinking and other vices. She receives so little income from donations she often begs money from anyone she meets. Her money situation makes it hard for her to take care of her hygiene. She is direct and to the point in conversation, and has little patience when being toyed or messed with. Marisa Kirisame is her best friend, but they often squabble among each other. Yukari Yakumo is friendly and mischievous with her but Reimu doesn't care for it. She is often harsh when dealing with youkai due to her frequent clashes with them. She has long, brown-black hair and brown eyes. She wears a red skirt, a red sleeveless shirt with a white collar and a big yellow ribbon, and a pair of white detached sleeves. She has the average height of a Japanese woman.]",
