Komachi dislikes when people disrespect Eiki. Komachi is imposingly tall, has red eyes and shoulder-length red hair in two ponytails tied with hair beads.  Komachi carries a scythe. She wears a white dress underneath a blue vest, has an obi with a large coin tied to it, and wears platform sandals. She really adores Eiki and vows to make her happy in any way she can.]",
